## The basic kit

### Tunic
#### General pattern

#### Considerations
You can make a tunic with less sewing if you take a piece of linen that has twice the length from your shoulders to your knees (plus a bit) and cut it to the form of a plus. The middle pieces will then be your arms. You only have to sew the sides, cut a slit for your head and then hem the edges.
Generally it is sensible to own more than one tunic, so you allways have one spare. Also a linen tunic was often used as the bottom garment (less scratchy than wool).
Especially in winter in regions north of the Alps it is not imaginable that romans were using the short sleeved tunics we know from Hollywood movies. Consider a length to your wrists and the usage of wool.

Tip: Natural linen can be obtained rather cheeply from IKEA (search for [AINA](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/30196944/)).

### Feminalia (trousers)

Alernatively you could use other patterns from that time like the [Thorsberg trousers](http://www.shelaghlewins.com/reenactment/thorsbjerg_construction/thorsbjerg_trews_construction.htm)

### Focale

### Penula (coat)
There are patterns with a square basis, a circle basis and semi-circle basis.

### Cingulum/Balteus
The main way to identify a legionary was by the plates attached to their belt, which was apparently not practiced by the general population. Over times, the width of the belts and the dangly bits at the front changed. A nice introduction to the used designs over time can be found in this [article by Eckhard Deschler-Erb](https://www.academia.edu/35955546/G%C3%BCrtel-_und_Riemenbeschl%C3%A4ge_in_den_Nordwestprovinzen._Das_milit%C3%A4rische_Formenspektrum_von_tiberisch_claudischer_bis_antoninischer_Zeit) (time-wise, the relevant examples would be towards the end, e.g. within Abb. 5)

Examples and tips on crafting can be found on [Legio XX](https://www.larp.com/legioxx/balteus.html)

### Shoes
Finds from wells and old ramparts on the Hadrian's wall do show a big diversity in shoes. North of the Alps people were using closed shoes in winter, so don't feel obliged to pick sandals. 

#### Calcei
Nice examples and crafting tips on [florentius](http://florentius.com/calcei-main.htm)

I am trying to sew Calcei without a last by using the turn shoe technique (sewing inside out, softening in water, then turning the shoe) with an attached leather sole with hobnails. Will update how that went.

## Advanced equipment
### Subarmalis
The roman equivalent of the mideval gambeson. A must underneath each armor (lorica) to prevent blunt trauma. Over time, more ptergys were added to the sleeves and bottom to protect the clothes from the armor.

Tips on [Legio XX](https://www.larp.com/legioxx/subarm.html) (They deem the body padding for lorica segmentata not as important as others do. Generally more padding helps avoid blunt trauma, even with metal plates.)

### Lorica segmentata
[M.C. Bishop's book on articulated roman plate armor](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301655364_Lorica_Segmentata_Volume_I_A_Handbook_of_Articulated_Roman_Plate_Armour)

Tips for building one can be found on [Legio XX](https://www.larp.com/legioxx/lorica.html) and this [article by Alex Matras](http://www.travelsoutwest.com/docs/seg_instr.pdf)

### Lorica hamata
The roman chainmail had small rings linked together. They had an inner diameter of 5-7mm and outside 7-9mm. A 5-in-1 pattern was used where the center ring was a closed ring like a washer, whereas the others were riveted together.
